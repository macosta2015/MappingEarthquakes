# MappingEarthquakes
Challenge 13


# GOAL
## The goal for thic challenge was to pulish our skills with HTML,CSS and JS. Note that we also used all tools that we have learned over time. Most importantly reading an API and working with it. 

## New tools:
#### Leaflet- "Open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications."
#### Mapbox API- "Mapbox is an advanced and flexible map service that can be integrated into mobile apps. Developers will have access to comprehensive location information to create and customize dynamic and static maps, thanks to the Mapbox tilesets."
#### GeoJason- "GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes."
### The tools ended up being hand as they taught us how to integrate our web development into maps


### We have added some filters where it is possible to have different versions of the webite.
